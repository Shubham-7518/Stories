So, finally we can say it was a really good journey of our
four year of engineering there was some great experiences 
where we don't have the knowledge of any programming language
sachin kapoor sir helps us a lot for building our programming
logics and can we hard worked on it.

Now i want to thanks my all faculty members who taught us
how to pass rgpv exams and supprot and guide us towards 
our goals.


finally i would like to thank my bro,mera yrr 
shivam malviya for being with me it was the story about both
of us.

thank you all
